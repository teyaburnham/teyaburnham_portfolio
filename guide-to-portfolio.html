<a id="a__User__Integrator_and_Developer_Help"><span/></a>Developer Help</h1>
<p class="Text_20_body">I've written for developer audiences at two companies, and since I enjoy the challenge of making complex information appear simple and easy to understand, this is one of my favorite tasks.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><p>For my first full-time technical writing job, I was brought on by Sight &amp; Sound Software (later bought by Datalex) to document a CORBA middleware travel booking engine, which was like learning to swim by jumping into the deep end of the pool. I documented everything in the system from the central CORBA components to XML configuration files, the rules engine, JavaScript interfaces (APIs), a proposed SMTP messaging system and various databases. The Director of Marketing at Sight &amp; Sound Software credited the help as a key factor in the landing of a major contract.</p></li>
<li><p class="Text_20_body">In my most recent job, at Intel, I documented the command line for three technical computing analyzer software products, which marketing identified as a documentation priority. The team had no standards as yet, so I worked with the lead writer, CLI developer and usability expert on the product that was in most active development to create standards. On my first pass through each of the product CLIs (first in Windows and then in Linux), I cataloged the state of each topic, testing it against application behavior, collecting questions, tweaking content structure and adding cross-links for usability. As my subject matter familiarity grew, I clarified content, added handy usage tips and expanded the sample commands. Eventually I had the time and expertise to add richer content in more of a cookbook style as requested by internal customers and to address issues gleaned from the developer forum. As the team moved to Agile I became co-owner of the CLI-related sections of the product message catalogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Also responsible for the Static Analysis Problem Type References and Static Analysis Getting Started Guide at Intel, I chose sample problems that illustrated interesting product capabilities and added productivity tips to make the user's first experience more compelling. </p></li>
<li><p>The third type of documentation I owned at Intel were the APIs and JIT developer documentation. The content was fairly static and much of it written by others, but I performed some light edits for usability on existing material, and documented one API from comments and raw data structures. My main contribution was adding information on using APIs to one of the cookbook-style topics I created for the main help.</ul>

<h1 class="Heading_20_1">
<a id=“a__saas_end_user_help”><span/></a>End User and Administrator Help for SaaS</h1>
<p class="Text_20_body">Most of the rest of my experience was spent documenting SaaS systems with multiple user types. The first was Kavi's collaborative platform for standards organizations, and the second was an event registration product for George P Johnson (later Project:Worldwide).</p> 
<ul><li><p>At Kavi Corporation I documented a variety of feature-rich applications, each of which had several types of administrators and users. This experience gave me a deep understanding and appreciation for collaborative platforms which remains with me to this day. Working with the co-founding architect, product manager, engineering manager, customer services manager and VP of Marketing among others, I eventually acquired significant expertise on email, mailing lists and HTML, and had opportunities to contribute to website marketing content, feature briefs, and release notes. I also drove a report on client system configuration and usage patterns in collaboration with QA, take aways included a new type of preconfigured mailing list, and new terms added to the UI to resolve overloading. Two client representatives specifically mentioned the help as one of the reasons they recommended Kavi collaboration tools to their standards organizations, also proving that some users do indeed read the help from start to finish, such as those at NISO and SMPTE - people deeply committed to mastering every aspect of the software on behalf of the organizations they proudly serve. </p></li>
<li><p class="Text_20_body">At GPJ/Project:Worldwide I documented many different applications.</p></li></ul>

<h1 class="Heading_20_1">
<a id="a__Database"><span/></a>Database Design and Documentation</h1>
<p class="Text_20_body">Studied object-oriented database design and programming at HSU, so I'm familiar with ERDs, data dictionaries and have some SQL.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After college, I worked as a CSR for a small manufacturer, where I managed inventory, sales and customer databases.</p></li>
<li><p>Worked with database administrators to document various travel portal databases and related applications at both Sight&amp;Sound and Datalex.</p></li>
<li><p> Created OO database designs for ICC and trained the office manager on the basics of OO theory and how to implement these designs. Considering how difficult OO was considered to be by everyone in college, her grasp of the basic theory was one of my proudest teaching moments.</p></li>
<li><p>Created a database when setting up the ASP shopping cart at First Books/Inkwater Press.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 class="Heading_20_1"><a id="a__Roles_and_Permissions"><span/></a>Roles and Permissions</h1>
<p class="Text_20_body">When the decision was made to expose role-based permissions to administrators at Kavi, some members of Customer Service struggled to grasp the abstract concept until I came up with the simple real-world metaphor of protected areas as locked rooms, and roles as key rings containing the appropriate set of keys (access permissions).</p>

<span class="T6">http://support.kavi.com/khelp/members/user_help/html/roles.html#roles_correspond_to_areas_figure</span></a></p></li>
<li><p class="P7">At Project:WorldWide, I created a series of hierarchy diagrams to make it easier for the Project Manager and BA to visualize and discuss roles and permissions.</p></li></ul>

<h1 class="Heading_20_1"><a id="a__XML"><span/></a>XML</h1>
<ul><li>
<p class="Text_20_body">Documented XML first at Sight &amp; Sound, which extensive information on the document model, XSLT and jQuery.</p></li>
<li><p class="Text_20_body">Later, Interactive Composition Corporation hired me as their in-house expert on XML markup, promoting me to Systems Manager two months later. I quickly mastered DocBook and various forms of proprietary XML. I developed an in-house training program on XML, served as liaison between our technical team in Delhi and client XML experts, and updated an old set of macros to apply one of these forms of XML, which served to increase the number and volume of our contracts.</p></li></ul>

<h1><a id="a__HTML"><span/></a>HTML</h1>
<p>Updated Kavi Editor help, a tool that a client organization uses to add and manage their site's web pages. The original help was authored by colleague Jason Grigsby, so I just tested the tool against the written content, and update screen captures. <a href="http://support.kavi.com/khelp/keditor/user_help/html/" class="Internet_20_link">http://support.kavi.com/khelp/keditor/user_help/html/</a></p>

<h1 class="Heading_20_1"><a id="a__Website_content"><span/></a>Website content</h1>
<p>I started writing website content in my first technical writing job, where I posted content on our internal website. After this, I took advantage of every available opportunity to get more experience with the web and web content.</p>
<p>At Kavi, all website content except for the Help content has been rewritten since my day, but product descriptions and other content still includes many of the concepts, terms and phrases that I introduced. These were gleaned from conversations with the co-founding architect, from meetings with client representatives, and repurposed from an unpublished paper that I co-authored with the VP of Marketing.</p>
<ul><li><p class="P7">Last time I checked, this fragment still appears in the first paragraph on the account's Home page (http://kavi.account.kavi.com/home) "...supports the work of your standards organization and members while minimizing the diversion of time and resources from the organization's mission."</p></li>
<li>
<p class="P7">Other terms and phrases that I added: "audit trail, risk reduction, accountability, ability to inject human moderators into otherwise automated processes, your organization's unique needs, faster time to market."</p></li></ul>

<p class="P4">Release notes - July 2008 Release Notes (14 Page PDF)</p>
<p class="P9">Kavi Mailing List Manager help: How Email Really Works - I wrote the text, with John Keith, Kavi Corporation architect, acting as SME. The graphic was created by Elise Keith, product owner. This topic still appears on page 1 of Google search results if you search for "how email works." (http://support.kavi.com/khelp/kmlm/user_help/html/how_email_works.html)</p>

<h1 class="Heading_20_1"><a id="a__Graphics"><span/></a>Graphics</h1>
<p>Some of my best diagrams were internal documentation created for ICC, Kavi and particularly for GPJ/Project:Worldwide. These are under NDA and cannot be shared. </p>
<ul><li>Interactive Composition Corporation - Process flow diagram designed to identified any brittle points in the production process, which were then closed.</li>
<li>GPJ/Project:WorldWide - Worked with project manager and BA to create graphic representation of the event registration workflow. Also created my most elaborate customer-facing art to date, based on GPJs beautiful branding. PM will confirm these efforts.</li>
<li>Kavi Product Suite and Components diagram - Clarified new product structure and application visibility, using Kavi branding color scheme (http://support.kavi.com/khelp/dotorg/user_help/html/productsuite.html) </li>
<li>Roles 'key ring' graphics - Came up with a simple analogy and set of graphics that instantly explains the concept (http://support.kavi.com/khelp/members/user_help/html/roles.html#roles_correspond_to_areas_figure)</li></ul>

<h1>Coding and Scripting</h1>
<ul><li>Sight&amp;Sound - Started by creating Word macros, then editing the macros. Created a number of Word templates with macros for use by engineers and SMEs, as well as macros that prepared Word docs for conversion to FrameMaker. Later edited some FrameScripts. </li>
<li>ICC - Used existing company forms as basis for Word forms backed by macros that wrote into Excel spreadsheets to streamline company processes and minimize errors. Used Perl with CGI script to generate email notifications. Authored VB script that used the Win32 API to eliminate traces of Shankar's Birthday malware from up to 200 docs at once for use by the production team. </li>
<li>First Books/Inkwater Press - Successfully set up ASP shopping cart for online sales.</li>
