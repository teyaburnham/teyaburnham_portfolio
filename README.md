# teyaburnham_portfolio

Welcome!

This repository documents some of my accomplishments as a technical writer.

The main document, guide_to_portfolio, highlights various skills and links to writing samples.
It includes links to documents that are currently available on the Internet.
In addition, some documents that were publicly available on the Internet in the past are included in this repository.
 
This is currently a work in progress. 

Thank you for your interest,
Teya Burnham
